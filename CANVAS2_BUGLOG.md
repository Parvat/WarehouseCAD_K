# canvas2 — Bug Journal

The narrative record of the Konva canvas bugs: what we saw, how long we chased
it, what turned out to be the real cause, and the exact fix. Companion to
`CANVAS2.md` (the rules). Read this before re-debugging anything here — several
of these bugs *look* like each other and we wasted rounds because of it.

The one meta-lesson across all of them:
- **Programmatic "PASS" ≠ works.** Automated Konva-event tests bypass the real
  input path and passed while the user's mouse failed. Every real fix below was
  confirmed only by a real mouse, at ~7% zoom, on a freshly generated layout.
- **Green build + green tests ≠ the app loads.** Runtime `X is not defined`
  passes both and white-screens the app. Always open it and check the console.
- **The old SVG engine was the reference all along.** It stayed clean for months
  because picking, bounds and resize were pure geometry (`objectContains`,
  `getObjectBounds`, `applyResize`) — not renderer hit-testing. Every time we
  drifted from that, it broke; every time we went back to it, it worked.

## BUG 1 — Resize/rotate handles broken for ~7 rounds (the long one)

**Symptoms (recurring, kept "coming back"):** rotate icon moved the selection
instead of rotating; no resize anchors; a "dummy" rack rotating in the
background; clicking a handle just started a drag.

**Why it took so long:** this was the migration-on-top-of-SVG era — Konva and SVG
were BOTH live, sharing one pointer surface, forwarding events, with painted
decoy handles on top of Konva's real ones. Every round fixed one real thing
(rotation not applied, decoys, a 1px floor-plan self-rect, missing imports) and
another surfaced, because the underlying arrangement — two renderers straddling
one input surface — kept generating new conflicts. Claude Code repeatedly
reported "verified PASS" because it tested programmatically at 100% zoom; the
user saw it broken at 7% by hand.

**The actual last cause:** the Transformer's anchors/rotater were fixed pixel
sizes inside the zoom-scaled Stage, so at the user's real ~7% zoom they shrank to
sub-pixel — invisible and un-grabbable. You were aiming at a painted decoy at a
different offset and falling through to a drag.

**Resolution:** we stopped patching and did a **clean-start canvas** (see
CANVAS2.md). The straddle, decoys and forwarding were deleted, not fixed. Handle
sizes are now `screenPx / stage-scale`.

**Lesson:** don't run two renderers over one input surface. And a "simple" thing
that fails 7× is usually the wrong architecture, not a stubborn bug.

## BUG 2 — Debug panel silently eating clicks

**Symptom:** clicks on racks whose screen position fell under the on-screen debug
panel did nothing — looked exactly like a hit-graph failure.

**Cause:** the debug panel is a DOM box over the canvas; `elementFromPoint`
returned the panel, so the Stage's mousedown never fired. Nothing to do with
Konva at all.

**Fix:** `pointerEvents: none` on the whole panel body; only the header
(buttons) re-enables it. (In `DebugPanel.jsx`.)

**Lesson:** a diagnostic that steals the clicks it exists to diagnose invents a
bug. Rule out the overlay before blaming the renderer.

---

## BUG 3 — Racks intermittently unclickable ("works sometimes")

**How we chased it (wrong turns, recorded so we don't repeat them):**
- Hypothesis "left side dead / right side works" — **disproved by the click log**
  (a left rack selected, the selected rack was on the left).
- Hypothesis "single-rows dead / double-rows work" — **disproved** (a double-row
  failed; a single-row worked).
- Hypothesis "hit-pad overreach steals neighbor's center" — a **real** effect
  found and fixed (asymmetric pad), but it was NOT the main bug.

**What actually found it:** an on-screen click log printing, per click,
`getIntersection` result + whether the point was inside the rack's drawn bounds
and hit-rect bounds. The decisive lines showed clicks **inside both drawn and hit
bounds still returning `getIntersection -> null`.** So the hit shape existed, the
click was on it, and Konva's hit graph *still* missed it — inconsistently, per
node, for reasons that varied (some nodes, some with corrupt bounds).

**Root cause:** relying on Konva's per-shape hit graph (`stage.getIntersection`)
for object picking. It depends on each node's hit region being built perfectly
and is silently inconsistent.

**Fix (the important one):** picking is now **geometry, not Konva's hit graph** —
ported the SVG's `hitTest(wx,wy)` (z-priority: annotations → objects →
column_grid on a real square only → floor plans last) returning the first object
where `objectContains(obj,wx,wy,zoom)` is true, plus `hitTestBay` for bays. This
is type-agnostic: single vs double rows behave identically. (CANVAS2.md rule 4.)

**Lesson:** we found this only when we stopped theorizing and made the code print
what it was doing. Instrument before hypothesizing.

## BUG 4 — Some racks not draggable + bay-select flaky (after the picking fix)

**Symptom:** after picking was fixed, everything selected, but some racks
wouldn't drag and single-bay selection was unreliable.

**Root cause:** Konva's native `draggable`/`dragstart` ran its OWN scene-graph
pick — a *second, independent* hit-test — alongside the geometry `hitTest` that
now drove selection. When the two disagreed for the same press, drag silently
failed, and bay-select raced the node's native drag-arm against its own logic.
Two hit-tests, two answers.

**Fix:** one pick drives both. Object nodes now carry **no event props at all** —
no `onMouseDown`, `onTap`, `draggable`, or `cancelBubble`; they are pure paint.
`onStageMouseDown` runs `hitTest` once and that same result both selects and arms
the drag (`beginDrag`). Konva's scene graph decides nothing about input.
(Commit `abb4419`.)

**Lesson:** there must be exactly ONE hit-test. Konva's built-in interactivity
(`draggable`, per-node handlers) is a competing pick — don't mix it with a
geometry pick. Nodes are paint; input is geometry.

## BUG 5 — Rack dragged out of a building still moves with it

**Symptom:** drag a rack outside the building, then drag the building — the
moved-out rack came along.

**Cause:** parentage wasn't recomputed after a move, so a rack that left the
building still claimed it as `parentId`, and the store's cascade dutifully
carried it.

**Fix:** after a move, `reparentMoved` recomputes each moved object's parent from
its new centre (`objectContains(fp, centre)`), calling
`attachToParent(id, fp?.id)` — `undefined` clears it. Matches the SVG's own
re-parent-after-move rule. Consequence to know: dragging a rack INTO a building
adopts it (intended).

**Lesson:** parent/child is a fact about position — recompute it whenever
position changes.

## BUG 6 — Selection outline stays at old position after a select-and-drag  (commit `c3b5719`)

**Symptom:** dragging a selection moves the objects, but the selection box stays
at the old spot and only snaps over later.

**Chased:** single-object and multi-select drags on an ALREADY-selected object
tested clean (obj/sel matched at every stage) — the bug only reproduced when
the press both selects an unselected object AND starts its drag in one
gesture, the normal way a user actually drags.

**Cause:** `beginDrag` collected the drag node set synchronously inside the
mousedown handler, right after the store write that selects the object. When
the object wasn't already selected, React hasn't committed the new
`<SelectionOutline>` into the Konva tree yet at that instant, so the node scan
never saw it — the outline sat still all through the drag and only caught up
once `moveObjects` forced a real re-render on mouseup.

**Fix:** re-collect the drag node set the moment the drag threshold is first
crossed (`collectDragNodes`, extracted from `beginDrag`), which always lands
after React has flushed the new outline. Also hardened `outlineBounds` to
measure a floor plan's `fpVerts` directly instead of its separate
`obj.x/y/width/height` fields, closing a latent gap between the two.

**Lesson:** a fix verified by "click, wait, then drag" can still miss the bug
that only shows up in "press and drag in one continuous gesture" — test the
gesture the way a mouse actually performs it, not a decomposed version of it.

## Known open (not selection/drag)

- **Corrupt rack bounds:** some racks report world bounds like −12549..688
  (13,000px wide) — a bad rotation/transform in the geometry. Independent of
  picking. Log the object's raw fields before fixing.
- ~~**`Canvas2.jsx` is a 29KB blob** doing input+drag+resize+Stage — split it,
  mirroring SVG's CanvasArea / CanvasObjectCore / CanvasOverlays. (CANVAS2.md
  rule 8.)~~ DONE: split into `Canvas2.jsx` (Stage/layer mounting + view),
  `useCanvasInteraction.js` (input/interaction: pan/marquee/drag/selection),
  `Overlays.jsx` (selection outline + marquee decoration), and
  `clickDiagnostics.js` (the temporary click-trace/census diagnostics, pulled
  out so rule 7's eventual deletion touches one file). Pure move, no behavior
  change — 307 tests green, real-mouse drag/selection/cascade re-verified at
  7% with identical results to before the split.
- **Open:**
  (1) bay-select only selects the whole row, not the bay — hitTestBay not wired to selection.\
  (2) On refresh, view loads too zoomed-out — should auto-fit on load.
  (3) Replace double-click-to-fit with a visible "Fit" button.
